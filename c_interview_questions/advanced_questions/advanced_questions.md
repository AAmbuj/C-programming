# Advanced C Interview Questions

## Question 1
Discuss the implementation of a singly linked list in C. Explain how to perform operations like insertion at the beginning, deletion of a specific node, and traversal. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a linked list compared to an array? How would you detect a cycle in a linked list? (Coding example will be provided for this question)

## Question 2
Explain the concept of a hash table. How does it work, and what are common collision resolution techniques (e.g., chaining, open addressing)? Discuss the time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations in an ideal hash table and in worst-case scenarios. (Coding example will be provided for this question - focusing on a simple chaining implementation)

## Question 3
Describe the difference between binary and text file I/O in C. What are the functions typically used for each (e.g., `fread`/`fwrite` vs `fprintf`/`fscanf`)? Discuss potential issues related to endianness and data portability when working with binary files. How would you implement robust error handling for file operations, including checking for `EOF` and file open errors?

## Question 4
What are function pointers in C and how can they be used to implement generic algorithms or callback mechanisms? Provide an example of using function pointers with `qsort` from `stdlib.h` to sort an array of custom structures. (Coding example will be provided for this question)

## Question 5
Explain how conditional compilation (e.g., `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif`) and macros with arguments can be used in C. Provide a scenario where you might use complex macros to generate code or create configurable logging utilities. What are the potential pitfalls of using macros, especially those with side effects?
