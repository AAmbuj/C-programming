# Intermediate C Interview Questions

## Question 1
Explain the concept of a pointer in C. How do you declare a pointer, initialize it, and dereference it? Provide an example.

## Question 2
What is pointer arithmetic? Give an example of how it works with different data types. What are the potential pitfalls of pointer arithmetic?

## Question 3
Describe the differences between `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `realloc()`. When should `free()` be used, and what happens if you forget to use it?

## Question 4
How are multi-dimensional arrays stored in memory in C? Explain how to pass a 2D array to a function. What is the difference between `arr[i][j]` and `*(*(arr+i)+j)`?

## Question 5
Discuss the key differences between an array and a pointer in C. Under what circumstances can array names decay into pointers?

## Question 6
What are null-terminated strings in C? List some common string manipulation functions from `<string.h>` and briefly explain their purpose.

## Question 7
Explain recursion in C. What are the necessary components of a recursive function? Provide a simple example, like calculating a factorial. What are the potential drawbacks of using recursion?

## Question 8
What are storage classes in C (`auto`, `extern`, `static`, `register`)? Briefly explain the scope, lifetime, and default initial value for each.

## Question 9
Explain the difference between `struct` and `union` in C. Provide an example where using a `union` might be beneficial. What are bit-fields within structures?

## Question 10
What is a void pointer (`void*`)? How is it used, and what are its advantages and disadvantages? How do you dereference a void pointer? What is a pointer to a function, and how can it be used?
